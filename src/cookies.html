    <p class="cookies-page__text">When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, we or our authorised service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies for storing information to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience, and to make advertising more relevant.</p>
    <p class="cookies-page__text">Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent). You're free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device allows this. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.</p>
    <h2 class="cookies-page__subtitle">What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?</h2>
    <p class="cookies-page__text">Like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites.</p>
    <p class="cookies-page__text">The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:</p>
    <ul class="cookies-page__list">
      <li>
        <p><span class="bold">Cookies</span>Cookies – Small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to recognise a particular device or browser. There are several types of cookies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.</li>
          <li>Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.</li>
          <li>First-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting.</li>
          <li>Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most commercial browsers. The preferences for each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="bold">Web beacons</span> – Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="bold">Similar technologies</span> – Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilising local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.</p>
